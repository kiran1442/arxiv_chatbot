# ArchiBot: Research Assistant Chatbot

## Overview

ArchiBot is an intelligent chatbot designed to assist users in querying research papers and exploring complex concepts. Built using advanced NLP techniques, ArchiBot leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate and concise answers to user queries based on the content of research papers. It also includes a summarization feature for better understanding.

## Features

- Paper Querying: Upload or provide the URL of a research paper in HTML format and ask questions about its content.

- Summarization: Automatically summarizes relevant sections of the paper for easier understanding.

- Contextual Answers: Generates answers based on retrieved content from the document.

- Streamlit Interface: User-friendly web interface for seamless interaction.

## Tech Stack

- Python: Core programming language.

- Streamlit: Web framework for creating the user interface.

- LangChain: Framework for building applications powered by LLMs.

- FAISS: Vector search library for similarity-based retrieval.

- Transformers: Used for text summarization with models like BART.

- GROQ LLM API: Provides access to the language model for generating answers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

- Access to GROQ API (Get your API key from GROQ).

<!--start code-->
### Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

<!--end code-->
